Here is an example format for an ATO document:

    ATO number and date/time group: e.g. ATO #001, valid from 0800Z to 1600Z on DD/MM/YYYY

    Mission commander's intent and objectives: a brief statement describing the mission's purpose and goals, such as "Destroy enemy ground forces in sector X and establish a defensive perimeter."

    Airspace and geographic boundaries: a description of the airspace and geographic boundaries in which the mission will take place, including any no-fly zones or restricted areas.

    Aircraft and weapons to be used: a list of the aircraft types and their configurations, as well as the types and quantities of weapons they will carry.

    Scheduled takeoff, landing, and in-flight refueling times: a detailed schedule of when each aircraft will take off, land, and refuel in flight, including any changes due to contingencies.

    Targets and objectives: a list of the targets and objectives for the mission, including their location, type, and priority level.

    Planned routes of flight and waypoints: a detailed plan of the routes each aircraft will take, including any waypoints, altitude and speed restrictions, and estimated time en route.
